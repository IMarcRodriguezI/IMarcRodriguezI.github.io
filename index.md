### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

     Lab ‘11,’ part ‘1,’ was my favorite because of the introduction to object oriented programming. 
     This is the case due to this concept being easier to understand and perform than
     procedural programming. Within this lab’s section, I learned about how to create classes
     and its constructors. Furthermore, I also learned about encapsulation. Where data
     should be hidden or being non-important to a user using an object, like a class. This 
     idea enforces the fact that objected oriented programming is simpler to use. 

* Lab 9

     Lab 9, part 2, was my favorite because I was curious as to how a program could access a
     file. I learned from this activity on how to put or retrieve data in or out of it respectively.   
     Along with this, I also learned that a user could input data into a file by using a program,
     based on certain criteria. Furthermore, a program could use this data from within a file to
     do a certain action. Overall, these concepts show how a program stores information
     effectively without running consistently. 

* Lab 7

     Lab ‘7,’ part ‘1,’ was my favorite because it introduced complex boolean expressions placed 
     into each if statement’s parameters. I learned about not just boolean expressions, but 
     also learning how to deal with multiple boolean statements combined into one. I had to
     document every scenario of each of my written complex boolean expressions, and adjust
     them accordingly. Overall, this back and forth scenario checking and adjustment helps me
     better understand how data is being used or compared to, within my program.
